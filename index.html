      <h1>Tones</h1>
      <p>
        I have a small guitar collection going, and I love every guitar I own.  As I've slowly
        leveled up as a guitarist, I've started to appreciate the importance of tone.  Since I can't
        easily play my guitars side-by-side to compare their sound, I recorded them all and put the
        recordings on this page for quick, easy review.

      <h2>What considerations did you take?</h2>
      <p>
        I recorded each guitar both clean and distorted.  For both clean and distorted recordings,
        I also provided a sample for both bridge and neck pickups.  So, each guitar has four total
        recordings available for review here.  I did not change any amp settings for this project,
        because I wanted as much as possible to provide an apples-to-apples comparison.  I ran the
        guitars through my Yamaha THX10II amp, with center EQ settings, high gain, and no effects
        other than a smidge of reverb.  The only adjustments I made were:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Recording volume, to balance clarity vs clipping
          </li>
          <li>
            Tone knob on the guitar (for clean only) to give each guitar a shot to put its best foot forward
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
